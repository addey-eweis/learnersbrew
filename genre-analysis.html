               <p>The purpose of this article is to examine and compare two texts: 'A Room with a View' and 'Wuthering Heights'. Both books are novels, but their genres are different.<br><br>

                  The genre of the text is important because it will help you identify similarities and differences between the novels. More importantly, genres can affect how people reading the text understand it.
                  Some main genres are historical fiction, science fiction, mystery/crime fiction, realistic fiction, fantasy/science-fiction/horror, romance/erotica and satire. Genres often include subgenres as well such as classic romance or science-fiction dystopia.<br><br>
                  
                  'A Room with a View' is a realistic romance novel and can be identified under the subgenre of 'bildungs roman'. The term 'bildungs roman' means it focuses on an individual's development, as the mystery of Lucy's parentage is important in understanding her. Both novels have their main female protagonists growing up and exploring new ideas.<br><br>
                  
                  Wuthering Heights can be classified as a gothic romance novel. In this genre, the plot tends to be character-driven rather than event-driven, such as in Wuthering Heights where most of the story is told through background information to Heathcliff's character.<br><br>
                  
                  The main difference between the two genres is that realistic romances are focused on the development of a character's moral and social values. On the other hand, gothic romances focus on individuals with dark pasts, who fall in love despite others' disapproval.<br><br>
                  
                  Both genres have their own distinctive features, but 'A Room with a View' is classified as a realistic romance because of its strong focus on growth and moral development while Wuthering Heights is placed under the romantic gothic genre because of its emphasis on Heathcliff's dark past over any character growth.<br><br>
                  
                  Of course, 'A Room with a View' and 'Wuthering Heights' can be found in the same Bookshelf categories. For example, both are (fictional) books written by English authors, and both have been written at some point in the past 200 years. However, one clearly falls under the romantic gothic genre while the other belongs under realistic romance because of their distinctive features. This is an important aspect to consider when you read or study texts.
