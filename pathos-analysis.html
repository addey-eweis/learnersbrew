               <p>Pathos is the quality of arousing feelings of pity or fear in an audience by describing a situation that seems hopeless. It is both inspiring and motivating to people in distress.<br><br>

                  Pathos has been used since ancient Greece to incite emotion, inspire feelings such as sympathy, admiration, love or despair. In the twentieth century, it was the major literary device used "to speak to man's deepest emotions."
                  In literature, it can lead people to sympathize with characters, and so view them as victims of tragic events or hard times. It can be used to persuade people to take a certain course of action, or make them feel pity.<br><br>
                  
                  Pathos is the opposite of the emotional appeal of Logos, but it is not antithetical to it. When pathos is present, logos must also be present. Pathos serves as the driving force of a literary work and must be backed up by logos so that the effect achieved by pathos will remain in the minds and hearts of readers or listeners.<br><br>
                  
                  The Greeks used pathos in their tragedies, such as the tragedies by Sophocles or Euripides. Character motivation is one of the goals of tragedy. A tragedy like "Oedipus" would lose its effectiveness if the audience's compassion for Oedipus' character was not aroused before they learn about his tragic fate. If he is not pitied, the audience's response to his story would be one of repulsion or indeed indifference.<br><br>
                  
                  In ancient Greece, tragedy was also used to offer moral instruction in harmony with the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle. It was also used by ancient playwrights to persuade an audience into accepting their political views, or to increase their enthusiasm for some cause or movement they favored. An example of this is "Antigone", a play by Sophocles which was a response to the Pelopennesian War, in which his heroines took the side of the enemy.<br><br>
                  
                  One of the main sources of pathos in literature is real life experiences. Many people have felt and shown real feelings of pity for persons who have been suffering from tragedy, but also some people have felt and shown fear at great tragedies or other events that seem inevitable or beyond human control. Thus, when writing a novel or story, it can be important to incorporate personal experience from the author's own life into the narrative.<br><br>
