               <p class="p-in-hooks-border">In an essay, two concepts are important: the thesis and the bridge. The thesis is your idea for your essay or what you try to convince the reader of by writing about it. This is typically a statement made in a paragraphâ€™s opening sentence that states what you want to write about. For example, I will write about how writers should not use things like Wikipedia as their primary source for research because they lack originality and morality and because they get access to information that others may not know." <br><br>

                  The bridge then picks up where the thesis leaves off and provides a transition into talking about your main point more specifically, so it can be explained in greater detail for readers. For example, in the paragraph above, I explained that writing is important because it is an art and should be original and moral.<br><br>
                  
                  Bridges are a common feature of academic essays. They can be defined as the part of an essay that bridges from the thesis to the body of paragraphs that explain the thesis in greater (or greater detail). This can be done by stating a general idea again or by tying into details from the thesis. They also usually provide evidence to help support or prove your statement, although this may occur within your bridge itself. An example of this would be: "I will use these reasons in my essay about how writers should not use things like Wikipedia as their primary source for research". They typically show that you are still thinking about and discussing the topic.<br><br>
                  
                  Bridges should provide evidence to support your thesis, but they can also provide evidence to support or refute your thesis. The bridge should not just reiterate the thesis; it should give examples of what you mean by your statement. An example of this would be: "I will prove this by using these examples to show that writers should not use Wikipedia."<br><br>
                  
                  In addition, a bridge does not necessarily have to explain or prove something. It might also include a transition into a body of paragraphs that explain more about the topic being discussed or talk about unrelated topics. Those paragraphs can also be evidence to support or refute the thesis. An example of this would be: "I will write about how writers should not use Wikipedia because it lacks originality and morality".<br><br>
                  
                  -Any examples? What is a bridge? How can I tell when it's effective or not?<br><br>

                  <p>The thesis statement is the most important part of an essay or a research paper. It's where you get to summarizing your argument, backing it up with evidence and examples throughout the essay, and explaining your position on an issue. In short, it's what your writing is all about.<br><br>

                     A thesis statement is usually the first sentence in an essay or the first few sentences in a research paper. It states your opinion on a topic, and it informs your readers of the direction that you'll be heading with the rest of your words. It's what ties everything together, so to speak. Taking out or muddying up your thesis statement can leave you with serious problems later on in your writing process.<br><br>
                     
                     What makes a good thesis statement? Effective thesis statements are clear and concise. A well-constructed sentence should be able to catch readers' attention right away.<br><br>
                     
                     In any case, a good thesis will always sound like this: "This is what I'm arguing in my paper/essay. Here's what I think about this subject. Here's what I'm trying to prove." It's up to you to back up that opinion with evidence and to explain your position in more detail.<br><br>
                     
                     The thesis statement should be a declarative sentence (i.e., a statement of fact, not a question) so that you know exactly where you stand from the very beginning. In order for the body of your paper or essay to follow through on what your thesis statement promises, you need to provide a thorough explanation using examples and evidence. This kind of clarity will make it easier for readers to understand exactly where you're coming from and evaluate whether they agree or disagree with your reasoning and evidence.<br><br>
                     
                     There's a lot of room for creativity when it comes to the structure of your thesis statement, but it should always contain the essential information. One trick that students often use is to replace the subject and verb in their thesis statement with a question. For instance, "This paper questions how effective telecommuting really is" becomes "Is telecommuting effective?" By turning your thesis statement into a question, you prompt your readers to reflect on what you're about to say. It also leaves open the possibility that they'll come up with an answer that you didn't consider before and thus have something new to think about (and write about) in your paper or essay.</p>
