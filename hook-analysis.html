               <p>A hook is a sentence or two at the beginning of an essay that piques the reader's interest in order to create suspense and grab their attention. It's generally a rhetorical question, paradox, anecdote, quotation, or saying. The purpose of the hook is to keep the essay’s readers reading and wanting to find out more about what you are about to say. <br><br>

                  Hooks can be found in letters as well as essays. Letters are usually structured with a "hook" at the top which leads into the body that includes information not obtained from previous correspondence which will answer unanswered questions from earlier correspondence thus concluding with a "closer". Letters are typically short, but it is possible for a letter to be long if the writer has interesting things to say.<br><br>
                  
                  Composers often use hooks in songs. The song "Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground" by John Scott Trotter was written with no intention of that being an actual song about angels. The words just happened to flow like that and now it's one of his most famous songs. On television, any episode that ends with a cliffhanger is said to have a hook which keeps viewers coming back for more TV shows. It is also common in movies and video games to use the hook to get you interested and is usually put at the beginning of the movie or game.<br><br>
                  
                  Hooks are commonly used in advertisements to bring their product(s) out from all of the other products that may be similar if they choose to do so. The main objective is to make their product stand out from the rest, which could be anything from a song, a scene, or a commercial.<br><br>
                  
                  Hooks can also refer to what attracts someone’s attention like when one is fishing "hooking" fish with a lure, or snagging people with printed ads by using eye-catching designs such as pictures and bold headlines.<br><br>
                  
                  A hook can be something that initially catches your attention and you want to know more. The hook is a way of intriguing the audience into finding out more about what you have to say about the subject you are writing about. It is like a tool that starts off to get the reader interested in what you have to say, it captures the attention of your readers right at the beginning.<br><br>
                  
                  Hooks can be a visual representation that catches your eye or an auditory representation that draws your attention with sound. Hooks can also be a question, an object, or something intriguing that makes you think about it for a moment and wonder about it. The hook is different for everyone because everyone notices different things.</p>
